Challenge 14 - belly_button_challenge

## Background

I built an interactive dashboard in order to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogs the microbes that colonize in human navels.  I began by preparing and pulling the dataset information from the D3 library provided.  I created a dropdown menu for each individual's information and then made a bar and bubble graph to show the top ten OTUs found within that individual.

#### Sources

1. https://github.com/mychele-larson/Belly-Button-Challenge/blob/main/static/js/app2.js - I used this source to help me correctly pull the data and create the graphs. I used this source when I could not figure something out as I wanted to figure it out on my own and I used it as a reference to ensure I was on the right track.
